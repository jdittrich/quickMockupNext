## QuickMockup Next

Possible future iteration of quick mockup. It will for the forseeable future be pre-alpha, so expect experiments rather than a demo application. 

## Running
1. Clone the repo
2. In the repo, run a http server, e.g. via Python3: `python3 -m http.server`. There is no build step, the project uses ES6 Modules.
